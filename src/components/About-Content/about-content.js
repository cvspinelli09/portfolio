        <p>Hi, my name is Cristian Spinelli, originally 4 years as graphic designer
        and marketing, then 13 years in sales and currently last couple years working as
        web developer.</p>
        <p> I can work on frontend projects, with a keen eye to design with
        attention to details, the same way I can also work in the backend
        and build a server file that will process all the interaction between the frontend
        and the database.</p>
        <p>But not just that. As someone with business management and sales / marketing background, I
        understand what drives entrepreneurs and local businesses when it comes to
        create your own loyal customers base.</p>
        <p>I can manage to solve part of your marketing needs with the production of your
        sales funnels - with the right copy for your business - focused on conversions.</p>
        <p>Go ahead and check my portfolio!</p>
